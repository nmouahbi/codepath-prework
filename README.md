## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[The only outside resources used to help complete my submission was w3schools and this a link to the page I used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I had a lot of challenges while working on this project. The first one was before starting my project. I found that my knowledge wasn’t that good. So, I had to make lot of research and watching YouTube videos just to understand the concept because I want to have an idea before I started working on the project. The second one was while working on the projects, The tutorial was very helpful and guided me through everything I just had to keep repeating it. Finally, I thought it will be good to add more features to show off that I understand the concept. I tried adding more codes to the style, script, and index files .some of them works some not , at the end I got the result I wanted .]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing my submission, I have a lot of questions about web development specially CSS, HTML, and JavaScript and how to make my way through this and learn more. Web development attract me after working with this project. I find frontend UI/UX design to be a creative outlet for people in my field Therefore, I would find it extremely interesting to dig into this type of work and see what I could create once I understand more of the properties associated with CSS,HTML,JavaScript]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project. I will add more buttons and work more with the CSS to make the app looks way better. I may also add extra audio tracks to make sound better when you are playing it. This app has rooms for lot of implementations, but it will take more time because I’m had to make more search and debugging. Finally, I think that what I did was great compared to my knowledge and this will be a great start for me what makes me want to do more and more projects like that.  ]
